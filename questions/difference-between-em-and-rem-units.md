title: "What is the difference between `em` and `rem` units?"
level: 1

Both `em` and `rem` units are based on the `font-size` CSS property. The only difference is where they inherit their values from.

- `em` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the parent element
- `rem` units inherit their value from the `font-size` of the root element (`html`)

In most browsers, the `font-size` of the root element is set to `16px` by default.
