A pseudo-class is a selector that assists in the selection of something that cannot be expressed by a simple selector, for example `:hover`. A pseudo-element however allows us to create items that do not normally exist in the document tree, for example `::after`.

Pseudo-classes examples:

- :link
- :visited
- :hover
- :active
- :focus

Pseudo-classes examples:

- ::before
- ::after
- ::first-letter
- ::first-line
- ::selection
