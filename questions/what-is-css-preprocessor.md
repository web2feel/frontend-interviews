A CSS Preprocessor is a tool used to extend the basic functionality of default vanilla CSS through its own scripting language. It helps us to use complex logical syntax like â€“ variables, functions, mixins, code nesting, and inheritance to name a few, supercharging your vanilla CSS.

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is the most commonly used css pre processor.
