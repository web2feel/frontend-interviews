The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called **reconciliation**.
In simple words, virtual DOM is just a copy of the original DOM kept in the memory and synced with the real DOM by libraries such as ReactDOM. This process is called Reconciliation.

Virtual DOM has the same properties that of the Real DOM, but it lacks the power to directly change the content of the screen.

Think of Virtual DOM as the blueprint of a machine, changes made to the blueprint doesn't reflects on the machine itself.
