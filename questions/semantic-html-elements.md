A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.

When elements like `<div>` and `<span>` tells nothing about its content, semantic elements like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<footer>` clearly defines their content.

Example:

```
<header>
<nav>
<section>
<article>
<aside>
<footer>
```
