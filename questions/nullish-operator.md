The nullish coalescing operator (??) is a logical operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is `null` or `undefined`, and otherwise returns its left-hand side operand.

```js
let user;
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // Anonymous (user not defined)
```

```js
let user = "John";
alert(user ?? "Anonymous"); // John (user defined)
```
