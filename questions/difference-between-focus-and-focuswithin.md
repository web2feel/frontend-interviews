The **Focus** pseudo-class is applied to an element. When that element is in focus the styling appears. Its commoly used for buttons, input box etc.

The **Focus-within** pseudo-class is assigned to a parent element. The styling rules are applied when any child element receives focus. Selecting an input, clicking a link, etc. This pseudo-class is most commonly usefull in creating nested drop-downs etc.
