You can `ternary operator` for this.
The syntax of ternary operator is

```js
condition ? <statement if true> : <statement if false>
```

In this case
The first number is 20 and the second number is 60
Here the code is like this..

```js
function findthelargest(num1, num2) {
  return num1 > num2 ? num1 : num2;
}
console.log(findthelargest(20, 60));
```
