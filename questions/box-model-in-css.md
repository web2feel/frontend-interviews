The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

- Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
- Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent

The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements.
