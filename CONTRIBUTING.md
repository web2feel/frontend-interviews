# How to contribute questions?

1. Fork this repository (Click the Fork button in the top right of this page).

2. Clone **your fork** down to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-interviews.git
```

3. Create a branch

```
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

4. Create your question file

Questions are stored as `.md` (_markdown_) files in the `/questions` directory. To add your question, create a new markdown file in the `/questions` directory, and give it an appropriate filename that suits the content.

Use the following format to create your question file.

```
---
title: "Define anonymous function"
level : 1
category: "JS"
---
It is a function that has no name. These functions are declared dynamically at runtime using the function operator instead of the function declaration.
```

The section between the two **`---`** contains the metadata of the page. The metadata contains the title, difficulty level, and frontend tech category information.

Look at the table below for available options.

| Key      | Value                                                                                |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| title    | "Your question title goes here"                                                      |
| level    | Enter any one number from **1** (_Easy_), **2** (_intermediate_), **3** (_advanced_) |
| category | Enter any one from "CSS", "HTML", "JS", "ReactJS". _This is case sensitive_          |

Any content that follows the metadata section is considered as the **answer** for your question.
